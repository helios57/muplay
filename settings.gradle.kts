// Plan 5 Task 8. The second APPLICATION module in this build, and the only module whose `minSdk` is
// not 26 -- Wear OS 3 is API 30 and Compose for Wear OS supports nothing earlier. That floor is set
// in `muplay.android.wear` (build-logic), never in this module's own `android { }` block.
include(":wear")

// Plan 7's own top-level source directory. Kept out of `core/` deliberately: `ConventionTest`'s
// `nothing outside integrations depends on an integration` makes "Plan 7 can be dropped" a checked
// fact rather than a promise, and that rule is written as a path prefix -- which only means
// anything while these modules live somewhere of their own.

// Plan 7 Task 4. Depends on `:integrations:core` and on nothing else in the build.
include(":integrations:lidarr")
// Plan 7 Task 8. The second service, and the module that turns "severable" from a claim into a
// demonstrated property: it depends on `:integrations:core` and on nothing else in the build --
// in particular not on `:integrations:lidarr`, which is the severability contract's third clause
// (neither service is reachable from the other's code path) stated as a build edge.
include(":integrations:bindery")
// Plan 7 Task 9. The composition root of this feature's data layer, and the only module that sees
// all three of the others: `:integrations:core`, `:integrations:lidarr` and `:integrations:bindery`
// all depend on it being somewhere else. Still inside the one directory a `git rm -r` removes.

# A REGRESSION LIST OF MUTATION PROBES. NOT A RULE, AND NOT A GATE.
# ============================================================================================
#
# Every probe below is a defect that was found by hand -- by an implementer's audit or by an
# independent review -- and then fixed. Each one names the single test that must now fail when the
# defect is reintroduced. Running this script re-applies each mutation to a committed tree, one at
# a time, and checks that the named test really does go red.
#
# WHAT PASSING THIS SCRIPT MEANS: the seventeen specific defects listed here are still caught.
#
# WHAT PASSING THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT MEAN -- read this before trusting a green run:
#
#   * It is NOT evidence that the "two disjoint observations per value" rule holds. It cannot
#     catch a parameter nobody wrote a probe for, and that is precisely what every finding in this
#     file's history was. F-4 (`offset` hardcoded to "0") and N-1 (all four `libraryId` stamps
#     hardcoded) both passed a full, green `./gradlew check` at 100% branch coverage before anyone
#     thought to probe them. A probe list is a memory of past mistakes, not a detector of new ones.
#   * It is NOT wired into `ConventionTest`, `check`, or any CI job, deliberately. A source scanner
#     for the same rule was built and measured during review: run against 45da49b it reported
#     exactly the nine wire defects with no false negatives, but at 9f747f3 it reported two false
#     positives (a second observation held in a `const val` rather than a string literal is
#     invisible to it), and it is structurally blind to both N-1 and N-2 -- stamps are not
#     `queryParameter` assertions, and neither is a URL host. A check that goes green while
#     `getRandomSongs` stamps every song with library 1 is worse than no check, because a reviewer
#     who trusted it would stop mutating by hand. This project has paid for that lesson enough
#     times; an honest "these are the probes we know about" is the most this can claim.
#   * Its ordinary, visible cost is drift: it needs a line added whenever someone finds a new
#     probe, and nobody is forced to. That cost was accepted knowingly, over silent false
#     assurance.
#
# ADD A PROBE whenever a review or an audit finds a value that one constant could satisfy. That is
# the only way this file stays worth running.
#
# Exits non-zero if any probe is not caught -- verified, not assumed: the first run of the full
# list exited 1 on the stale `auth/empty-authParams` count above.
#
# SCOPE. Production-code mutations only. The falsifiability probes for `LiveNavidromeTest`'s six
# scoping assertions are *test-side* (they change which musicFolderId the test sends, to prove the
# assertion discriminates rather than that the client is right), so they do not belong here; they
# are recorded in task-3-report.md instead. This script runs the JVM suites only and needs no
# Navidrome container.
#
# USAGE:  ./ci/mutation-probes.sh            # all probes; MEASURED ~13 min for 17 (~46 s each)
#         ./ci/mutation-probes.sh stamp      # only probes whose id contains "stamp"
#
# The tree must be clean: every probe reverts with `git checkout --`, which cannot tell a probe
# from uncommitted work. Committing before mutating is a standing rule on this project because
# that exact revert destroyed real work twice during Plan 2 Task 3.

# `expected failures` is asserted too, not just "the named test failed": a mutation that reddens
# half the suite is not the precise discrimination these tests claim to provide, and a probe that
# only checked its own test would not notice that.
#
# It also means the counts are MEASUREMENTS, and they go stale when tests are added. The first full
# run of this script reported `auth/empty-authParams` as MISSED at 13 because round 2 had added a
# fourteenth request-asserting test since that number was measured -- the named test failed exactly
# as intended. So: if a probe reports MISSED but its named test *is* in the failing list, the count
# is out of date, not the code. Re-measure and update the number here; do not delete the check.
# Every other probe expects 1, and for those a count above 1 is a real signal worth reading.
